All patients will take folic acid to minimize toxicity, according to local guidelines. Patient may remain on a stable dose (= 8 weeks) of sulfasalazine (up to 3000 mg/day) and/or hydroxychloroquine (up to 400 mg/day) in combination with MTX. If previously experienced toxicity or lack of efficacy on MTX, patient may be on a stable dose (= 8 weeks) of sulfasalazine and/or leflunomide (up to 20 mg/day). Hydroxychloroquine (up to 400 mg/day) is allowed in combination with these DMARDs. Other oral DMARDs are not allowed within 4 weeks prior to screening.
9. Patients currently taking non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral corticosteroids (not to exceed the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day), must be on a stable dose = 4 weeks prior to screening and remain on that stable dose during the treatment period of the study.

a) Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening and at baseline (Day -1) and must agree to be sexually abstinent or use 2 highly effective methods of birth control during the study and for 3 months following last dose of XmAb5871, out of which one must be a physical barrier method. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence, hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), or any barrier methods (sponges, female condoms) used by the woman in addition to contraception used by their male partner such as vasectomy or condom supplemented with spermicide.
b) Women of documented non-childbearing potential (i.e., postmenopausal by history with no menses for one year and confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level [using local reference ranges], OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy).
13. Male patients can be of either childbearing or non-childbearing potential and must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and continuing for 3 months after the last dose of XmAb5871.

A lower MTX dose is acceptable if it is the highest tolerated dose; however, toxicity documentation by the Investigator is required. All patients will take folic acid to minimize toxicity, according to local guidelines. Patient may remain on a stable dose (= 8 weeks) of sulfasalazine (up to 3000 mg/day) and/or hydroxychloroquine (up to 400 mg/day) in combination with MTX. If previously experienced toxicity or lack of efficacy on MTX, patient may be on a stable dose (= 8 weeks) of sulfasalazine and/or leflunomide (up to 20 mg/day). Hydroxychloroquine (up to 400 mg/day) is allowed in combination with these DMARDs. Other oral DMARDs are not allowed within 4 weeks prior to screening.
9. Patients currently taking non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral corticosteroids (not to exceed the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day), must be on a stable dose = 4 weeks prior to screening and remain on that stable dose during the treatment period of the study.
10. Normal or clinically acceptable electrocardiogram (ECG) values (12-lead reporting ventricular rate and PR, QRS, QT and QTc interval) at screening and baseline (Day -1) based on opinion of the Investigator.

12. Women can be of either childbearing or non-childbearing potential as per below:
a) Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening and at baseline (Day -1) and must agree to be sexually abstinent or use 2 highly effective methods of birth control during the study and for 3 months following last dose of XmAb5871, out of which one must be a physical barrier method. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence, hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), or any barrier methods (sponges, female condoms) used by the woman in addition to contraception used by their male partner such as vasectomy or condom supplemented with spermicide.
b) Women of documented non-childbearing potential (i.e., postmenopausal by history with no menses for one year and confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level [using local reference ranges], OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy).
13. Male patients can be of either childbearing or non-childbearing potential and must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and continuing for 3 months after the last dose of XmAb5871. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence, vasectomy or a condom in combination with barrier methods, hormonal birth control or IUD used by the woman.
14. Able and willing to complete the entire study according to the study schedule.
E.4 Principal exclusion criteria: 1. History or evidence of a clinically unstable/uncontrolled disorder, condition or disease (including but not limited to cardiopulmonary, oncologic, renal, metabolic, hematologic or psychiatric) other than RA, that in the opinion of the Investigator or Xencor physician would pose a risk to patient safety or interfere with the study evaluation, procedures or completion.

All patients will take folic acid to minimize toxicity, according to local guidelines. Patient may remain on a stable dose (= 8 weeks) of sulfasalazine (up to 3000 mg/day) and/or hydroxychloroquine (up to 400 mg/day) in combination with MTX. If previously experienced toxicity or lack of efficacy on MTX, patient may be on a stable dose (= 8 weeks) of sulfasalazine and/or leflunomide (up to 20 mg/day). Hydroxychloroquine (up to 400 mg/day) is allowed in combination with these DMARDs. Other oral DMARDs are not allowed within 4 weeks prior to screening.
9. Patients currently taking non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral corticosteroids (not to exceed the equivalent of 10 mg of prednisone per day), must be on a stable dose = 4 weeks prior to screening and remain on that stable dose during the treatment period of the study.

a) Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test during screening and at baseline (Day -1) and must agree to be sexually abstinent or use 2 highly effective methods of birth control during the study and for 3 months following last dose of XmAb5871, out of which one must be a physical barrier method. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence, hormonal birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), or any barrier methods (sponges, female condoms) used by the woman in addition to contraception used by their male partner such as vasectomy or condom supplemented with spermicide.
b) Women of documented non-childbearing potential (i.e., postmenopausal by history with no menses for one year and confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level [using local reference ranges], OR history of hysterectomy, OR history of bilateral tubal ligation, OR history of bilateral oophorectomy).
13. Male patients can be of either childbearing or non-childbearing potential and must be willing to use a highly effective method of birth control for the duration of the study and continuing for 3 months after the last dose of XmAb5871. Highly effective methods of birth control include sexual abstinence, vasectomy or a condom in combination with barrier methods, hormonal birth control or IUD used by the woman.
14. Able and willing to complete the entire study according to the study schedule.
